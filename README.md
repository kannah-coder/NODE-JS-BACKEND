 # 🧠 NODE-JS-BACKEND

A complete **Node.js + Express.js** backend project demonstrating REST API development, routing, MongoDB integration, and basic CRUD operations.

## 💡 What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is a **JavaScript runtime environment** that allows you to run JavaScript **outside the browser** — on your computer or a server.

Normally, JavaScript runs only inside browsers like Chrome or Firefox.  
But with **Node.js**, you can execute JavaScript directly on your system — just like Python or C.

## ⚙️ How Node.js Works

Node.js is built on **Chrome’s V8 Engine** (the same one used in Google Chrome).  
It adds extra capabilities to JavaScript such as:

- 📁 File system access  
- 🌐 Creating web servers  
- ✉️ Handling HTTP requests/responses  
- 🧾 Reading and writing files  
- 🗄️ Connecting to databases  

With these features, you can use JavaScript to build:
- Backend servers  
- REST APIs  
- Real-time chat apps  
- Command-line tools

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for backend  
- **Express.js** – Fast and minimal web framework  
- **MongoDB (Mongoose)** – Database for storing data  
- **Postman / Thunder Client** – API testing  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control
